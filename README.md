<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## A little about this code

Just to practice something I learned some time ago.

I make a fetch to an api and display the street, neighborhood, city and state. Just using three functions:

* getDataFromApi() - Responsible for bringing backend data;

* transformUpperCaseFirstLetter() - Transforms the first letter of the word into uppercase;

* createAndFillElement() - Creates the HTML element and fills it.

I used only for this purpose vanilla js
